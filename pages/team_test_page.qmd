# Overview (Level #1)

This is our plot for the first homework.


## Sub-Section (Level #2)
Our plot was made by Daniella, who is working as collaborator 3.

### Our Plot! (Level #3)

The plot may feel stretched. If this is the case, you will want to determine good plot-saving settings for a website. 

For example, controlling the plot saving parameter argument of `ggplot::sggsave()` using `units = "px"` (pixels) and specifying the width (in pixels) and height (in pixels) may be a good approach. You can determine what pixel dimensions would be good for a webpage by doing and Internet search. 

Example:

- `width    = 1600`
- `height   = 1100`
- `units    = "px"`
- `dpi      = 200` `# or "retina"`
