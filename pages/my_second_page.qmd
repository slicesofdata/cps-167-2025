Another variable examined in this project  is educational background, represented by the `peeduca` variable, which captures the highest level of education attained by each respondent in the CPS dataset. Education is a key determinant in labor market outcomes, influencing employment opportunities, earnings potential, and overall career mobility.For this reason, we analyze how unemployment rates vary across educational backgrounds during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery period.
