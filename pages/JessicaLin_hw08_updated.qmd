# Assembling your Elements 

You will ensure that your data and plotting scripts needed for creating your plot are used to build the up-to-date version of the plot.

## Code Block for Sourcing Your Scripts

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# source data-related scripts 

# source plotting script(s)
source(here::here("src", "figs", "plotting.R"))
```

## The Modified Plot

Describe why you might want to implement this approach.

First is the x-axis label, now it's all 4 digits which is the correct way of indicating the year. I added one segment label using the annotate() function to mark the threshold/margin in the BLS system to differentiate short-term and long-term unemployed time and it was 15 weeks. So by this, we can shift the audience's focus back onto how the covid pandamic was influencing the unemployment patterns as 2020 and 2021 was the only two years that had almost every racial group's mean unemployment time over the long-term mark. 


## Code Block for Embedding your PNG

```{r}
# plot with a caption

#| fig.cap: "Mean Unemployment Time by different racial groups"
#| fig.align: "center" # to center plot on page if desired
#| out.width: "100%"   # or some other % appropriate for you site

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "mean_race_unemploy.png"))
```
