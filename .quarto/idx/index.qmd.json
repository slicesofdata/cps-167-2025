You will build a Quarto website for a target audience to communicate data visualized in ways to communicate patterns, trends, in data or to tell a story about data. There are more advanced styling you can modify with Quarto websites but this template is a good starting point if you are unfamiliary with Quarto.\n\n--- \n\n<!-- the 3 hyphens seen above create an optional break on the page.
