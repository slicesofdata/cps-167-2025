Write you code to create your plot and save it. Save this script in `src/figs`. The source code does not need to be on the website. \n\n2. Ensure that your plot is saved to `figs/` by referencing the path with **{here}**.\n\n3. At the top of the `.qmd` file for your page, add a code block that `source()`s the script that will generate the plot you wish displayed on that page. \n\nFor example:\n\n```{.r}\nsource(here::here(\"figs\", \"point_mpg_by_wt.R\"))`\n```\n\nMake sure to edit the code block so that the code runs only (no output).\n\n**NOTE**: Code blocks that appear in `.qmd` files will call `.R` files only. Do **NOT** embed code blocks in your `.qmd` file(s) that will process data or create plots directly. Reserve `.qmd` files for website text, sourcing script files, and calling `.png` plot files. Developers and engineers compartmentalize project elements and do not combine all content into a single files.

You certainly want this feature so that new website elements and files are built during the rendering process. A full website re-build, however, is unnecessary when no element of the website changes other than the images and figures embedded within it. As a result, re-builds are not always necessary and will increase update time.\n\n\n\n## Header Level 2: (Optional) Circumventing a Full Website Build \n\nSometimes the main structure of your website is untouched but you have new data and you need to run a rebuild of your plots. Although re-rendering is not problematic, it might just take longer than you desire. If you don't need to render the website and just want to build files, the following is a solution, though requires some extra work.\n\nTo avoid a full site rebuild (re-render) when you simply want to create and `git push` new plots:\n\n- Add your `source()ing` code to a separate file, for example, `call_scripts/call_plot_scripts.qmd`.\n- Add a code block to source individual `.R` files or all `.R` files in a directory.\n\nExample:\n\n```{.r}\n#| include: false\n\n# source a script file that this page depends on\nsource(here::here(\"figs\", \"point_mpg_by_wt.R\"))\n```\n\n- This `.qmd` file will render and create the `.png` files you need in your specified directory but the page will not be linked on your website. Technically, it will be visible at `https://the_url/call_scripts/call_plot_scripts.html` but this will be difficult to find. You can always remove the file or directory after rendering the website if you want to remove it completely.\n\n4. Link the plot `.png` file in your `.qmd` file.  \n\nOnce you know the name and location of the file, you can reference it like this, where the `.png` file is being pulled from `figs/`:\n\n![a plot description](../figs/point_plot_mpg_by_wt.png)\n\n\n### Linking to Image Example\n\nSimilarly, save your image in a folder like `images/`, and use this format to show it:\n\n![short description if necessary](../images/random_png.png)\n\n## Hyperlinks to internal website pages\n\n### External Websites\n\nRefer to an outside url:\n\n[Text to display](https://www.cmc.edu)\n\n\n### Internal website Pages\n\nRefer to the rendered HTML files:\n\n- [Visit the Home Page](index.html)\n- [Read the About Page](about.html)\n- [Got to another page](pages/my_second_page.html)\n\n<!--\n[text...](website_files/pages/my_second_page.qmd) \n-->\n\n**Tip:** LInk to `.html` files and **not** the `.qmd` file.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Overview\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org) files are structured similar to R Markdown files.
