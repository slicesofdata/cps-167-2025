(Level #3)\n\nThe plot may feel stretched. If this is the case, you will want to determine good plot-saving settings for a website. \n\nFor example, controlling the plot saving parameter argument of `ggplot::sggsave()` using `units = \"px\"` (pixels) and specifying the width (in pixels) and height (in pixels) may be a good approach. You can determine what pixel dimensions would be good for a webpage by doing and Internet search. \n\nExample:\n\n- `width    = 1600`\n- `height   = 1100`\n- `units    = \"px\"`\n- `dpi      = 200` `# or \"retina\"`\n\n<!-- \n- link to the file with an optional caption \n- use ![](../path to file/filename.png)\n-->\n\n![First Plot](../figs/cty_hwy_mpg_point.png)\n\n### Plot with `width` configurations\n\n![The Second Plot](../figs/cty_hwy_mpg_point.png){width=2600, height=1080}\n\n\n\n### Our Plot with `width` configurations and no caption\n\n![](../figs/cty_hwy_mpg_point.png){width=500}\n\n",
