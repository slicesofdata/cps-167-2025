The dataset covers a wide range of variables as well, including employment and unemployment status, income, educational background, household structures, and other demographic characteristics. Because of this rich demographic variables, the CPS is one of the few datasets that allow researchers to examine not only broad labor market trends, but also the distributional impacts on different diverse groups.\nIt has also maintained a consistent survey design since the 1940s, which allows researchers to make meaningful comparisons over time and track how labor markets respond to major events and economic recession for example Covid-19 which is the main focus of our group"

You can determine what pixel dimensions would be good for a webpage by doing and Internet search.\nExample:\n\nwidth    = 1600\nheight   = 1100\nunits    = \"px\"\ndpi      = 200 # or \"retina\"\n\n\n\n\nPlot with width configurations\n\n\n\nOur Plot with width configurations"
