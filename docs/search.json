The source code does not need to be on the website.\nEnsure that your plot is saved to figs/ by referencing the path with {here}.\nAt the top of the .qmd file for your page, add a code block that source()s the script that will generate the plot you wish displayed on that page.\n\nFor example:\nsource(here::here(\"figs\", \"point_mpg_by_wt.png\"))` \nMake sure to edit the code block so that the code runs only (no output).\nNOTE: Code blocks that appear in .qmd files will call .R files only. Do NOT embed code blocks in your .qmd file(s) that will process data or create plots directly. Reserve .qmd files for website text, sourcing script files, and calling .png plot files. Developers and engineers compartmentalize project elements and do not combine all content into a single files. Doing so creates many problems not limited to code breaking and code-repair problems, Git merge problems, etc. You will follow a similar practice of breaking the project into pieces, save those files, and push them to the remote repository weekly for your team members.\nThis code-source()ing step also ensures that plot(s) are (re)created when Quarto rendering the website build files. You certainly want this feature so that new website elements and files are built during the rendering process. A full website re-build, however, is unnecessary when no element of the website changes other than the images and figures embedded within it. As a result, re-builds are not always necessary and will increase update time."

If you don’t need to render the website and just want to build files, the following is a solution, though requires some extra work.\nTo avoid a full site rebuild (re-render) when you simply want to create and git push new plots:\n\nAdd your source()ing code to a separate file, for example, call_scripts/call_plot_scripts.qmd.\nAdd a code block to source individual .R files or all .R files in a directory.\n\nExample:\n#| include: false\n\n# source a script file that this page depends on\nsource(here::here(\"figs\", \"point_mpg_by_wt.R\"))\n\nThis .qmd file will render and create the .png files you need in your specified directory but the page will not be linked on your website. Technically, it will be visible at https://the_url/call_scripts/call_plot_scripts.html but this will be difficult to find. You can always remove the file or directory after rendering the website if you want to remove it completely.\n\n\nLink the plot .png file in your .qmd file.\n\nOnce you know the name and location of the file, you can reference it like this, where the .png file is being pulled from figs/:\n\n\n\na plot description\n\n\n\nLinking to Image Example\nSimilarly, save your image in a folder like images/, and use this format to show it:\n\n\n\nshort description if necessary"

The dataset covers a wide range of variables as well, including employment and unemployment status, income, educational background, household structures, and other demographic characteristics. Because of this rich demographic variables, the CPS is one of the few datasets that allow researchers to examine not only broad labor market trends, but also the distributional impacts on different diverse groups.\nIt has also maintained a consistent survey design since the 1940s, which allows researchers to make meaningful comparisons over time and track how labor markets respond to major events and economic recession for example Covid-19 which is the main focus of our group"

Even though the y-axis percentages are relatively small, they reflect meaningful differences in economic vulnerability.\nLong-term unemployment is a crucial measure in labor-market analysis because it reflects more than just temporary job loss, it signals deeper structural barriers that prevent individuals from successfully re-entering the workforce. When someone remains unemployed for an extended period, they are more likely to experience skill deterioration, weakened professional networks, and increasing challenges in securing future employment due to employer stigma associated with long job gaps. These barriers can create a cycle in which long-term unemployed individuals face progressively fewer opportunities, making it significantly harder to regain stable employment.\nIn addition, by using proportions rather than raw counts allows us to make meaningful comparisons across racial groups that differ in population size. Raw numbers can be misleading because a larger racial group will naturally have more individuals experiencing long-term unemployment simply due to its size, even if the risk of long-term unemployment is relatively low. Proportions standardize the measure, expressing long-term unemployment as a share of each group’s unemployed population, which enables us to evaluate disparities in likelihood rather than just absolute magnitude."
