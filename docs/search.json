    "text": "One of our key demographic variables is a person’s veteran status. It determines our study’s scope and impact for our target population and audience of interest, the United States Government. The following visualizations establish key information on the population of survey respondents that are veterans. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 1: Count of Respondents and their Veteran status.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, the United States reported having a total of 15.8 American veterans. They receive support from the United States Department of Government Affairs, including services like housing, healthcare, and employment support. Given it is a large federal department, they budgeted 441.3 billion for the 2026 Fiscal Year. \nFigure 1 demonstrates the amount of respondents and their status as either a veteran or having never served for the United States government. The Community Population Survey (CPS) fails to capture all of the household who identify as veterans or non-veterans. They take a sample of American households, meaning that the number of veterans reported by CPS is much less than the government’s reported number. CPS respondents are largely non-veterans or of unknown status. Notably, the number of respondents in 2023 increased for both groups, while veteran respondents remained largely stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure 2: Count of Respondents and their Veteran and Race Demographics\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 gives us more information about the two groups of interest, non-veterans and veterans. The visualization further divides the variables by the race of the respondents, breaking it down into white and non-white. This study will discuss the role of race further in a separate page. Figure 2 emphasizes the discrepancies among the different demographics in the CPS respondents. White groups are the largest group responding to CPS and Non-White respondents are the fewest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure 3: Unemployment Duration (in weeks) Density Distribution Across Veteran Status\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to the analysis of the veteran and non-veteran variable, Figure 3 compares the two groups and the shape of the data across their unemployment duration. Both groups have a larger density of respondents report their unemployment lasting under 10 weeks. From there, the density decreases until a slight increase at 50 weeks. The non-veteran group has slightly more variation after the 10 week mark. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figure 4: Proportion of People Unemployed for 9 Weeks, 2020-2024\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing figure 3, the team discovered that the median weeks of unemployment duration, across both groups, is 9 weeks. Figure 4 works off this finding to see how the proportion of people who are either veterans or not changes across our time frame of interest at the 9 week mark. The majority of people unemployed for 9 weeks are non-veterans, this is to be expected as the majority of respondents are non-veterans. Interestingly, the proportion of veterans unemployed for 9 weeks noticeably increases in 2022, with slightly under one fourth of respondents being veterans.\nThe remaining analysis will dive into more depth about how unemployment impacts different demographic groups and connecting it back to the variable of veteran status."

    "text": "Education plays a central role in shaping how workers experience unemployment, especially during periods of economic disruption. The four plots in this section work together to show that educational attainment influenced both the likelihood of becoming unemployed during COVID and the difficulty of returning to work afterward. By presenting these patterns in multiple ways, the analysis shows that education was one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of labor market resilience.\nThe first plot provides the foundation by comparing unemployment duration across education levels. This simple snapshot shows a clear divide: workers with less education, such as high school dropouts and high school graduates, experienced much longer unemployment spells. In contrast, individuals with college degrees had significantly shorter durations. This baseline establishes that education was strongly linked to job search length during the pandemic.\nThe second plot expands this story by adding a time dimension. Instead of comparing groups at one moment, it follows each education level across the months from 2019 to 2024. This reveals that although all groups were affected at the start of COVID, their recovery paths diverged sharply. College-educated workers returned to pre-pandemic levels by around 2022, while workers with lower education levels faced a slow and uneven recovery. This plot directly answers the question of which groups bounced back fastest—and it shows that education shaped not just the immediate shock but also the long-term recovery trajectory.\nThe third plot looks at how education interacts with another important demographic factor: veteran status. By examining unemployment duration for veterans and non-veterans within each education category, the plot highlights that education does not operate in isolation. Some groups, such as veterans with lower education, appear to face compounded difficulties, while higher education narrows gaps between veterans and non-veterans. This comparison helps show that educational disadvantage can intersect with other identity factors to create deeper inequality in labor market outcomes."

    "text": "#1 Unemployment Duration by Education Level\nThis plot compares unemployment duration across workers with different levels of educational attainment. The boxplots display the distribution of unemployment spells for each education group, allowing us to observe both the spread and central tendencies. We also added a red dashed line indicating the overall median unemployment duration across all groups, which helps visually compare how each education category deviates from the national median.\nContrary to expectations that individuals with lower education would face the longest unemployment spells, the graph shows that high school graduates, individuals with some high school education but no diploma, and even those with a bachelor’s degree have median unemployment durations that fall above the overall median of roughly 10 weeks. This suggests that unemployment challenges during the COVID period did not fall strictly along a simple “more education equals shorter unemployment” pattern.\nWhy it matters: This visualization provides an important baseline for understanding how education level shapes labor-market vulnerability. While prior research and intuition often suggest that lower-educated workers experience longer unemployment spells, this plot shows that several groups across both lower and higher education categories were significantly affected.\nThis nuance is especially meaningful in the context of COVID-19 recovery. The pandemic disrupted industries unevenly, and this pattern of unemployment duration suggests that both lower-skilled and some higher-skilled workers faced prolonged difficulties reentering the workforce. Identifying these disparities helps policymakers and researchers better understand which educational groups were hit hardest and who may need targeted interventions to support employment recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Unemployment duration by education level"

    "text": "#2 Unemployment Duration Over Time by Education\nThis time-series plot tracks how unemployment duration changed for each education group from 2019 to 2024. The curves show how all groups experienced a sharp rise in unemployment duration in 2020, followed by very different recovery paths. College-educated workers recovered relatively quickly, while workers with only a high school degree or less saw a slower and more uneven decline.\nWhy it matters: This plot shifts the analysis from levels to trajectories. It reveals which education levels “bounced back” the fastest and shows that the long-term effects of the pandemic were far more persistent for lower-educated workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Unemployment duration by education level overtime"

    "text": "#3 Unemployment Duration by Education and Veteran Status\nDescription: This plot compares unemployment duration for veterans and non-veterans within each education category. The median number for each group is written in each boxed plots. By showing how these two identities intersect, it uncovers differences that are not visible in education-only comparisons. For some groups—especially those with lower education—veterans may face longer unemployment spells than non-veterans. Higher education seems to narrow these gaps. Interestingly, we found that the veteran group with bachelor’s degree has a harder time bouncing back form unemployment with a median of 12 weeks compared to the non-veteran group with bachelor’s degree with a median of 8 weeks.\nWhy it matters: This plot shows that education interacts with veteran status in important ways. It demonstrates that educational disadvantage can be compounded by other demographic factors, revealing layers of inequality that influence unemployment duration.\n\n\n\n\n\nunemployemtn duration by education and veteran status"

The dataset covers a wide range of variables as well, including employment and unemployment status, income, educational background, household structures, and other demographic characteristics. Because of this rich demographic variables, the CPS is one of the few datasets that allow researchers to examine not only broad labor market trends, but also the distributional impacts on different diverse groups.\nIt has also maintained a consistent survey design since the 1940s, which allows researchers to make meaningful comparisons over time and track how labor markets respond to major events and economic recession for example Covid-19 which is the main focus of our group"

    "title": "Discovering Labor Patterns in Racial Groups",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Although our primary focus is on examining unemployment patterns across different veteran-status subgroups, it is valuable to incorporate race as an additional demographic variable. Race is a well-established determinant of labor-market outcomes, shaping access to employment opportunities, exposure to discrimination, educational pathways, and long-term earnings trajectories. By visualizing unemployment patterns across racial groups, we gain a deeper understanding of how these structural disparities may interact with veteran status.\nIncluding race allows us to better account for the intersectional nature of labor-market experiences. For example, the unemployment challenges faced by Black veterans may differ meaningfully from those faced by White or Hispanic veterans, even within the same veteran-status category. Without considering race, these nuanced patterns could remain obscured, potentially leading to oversimplified interpretations of unemployment trends.\nIncorporating race as a supplementary demographic factor therefore strengthens our analysis by acknowledging the multiple, overlapping social identities that shape individuals’ economic outcomes. It enables a more comprehensive and equitable assessment of unemployment dynamics, ensuring that policy implications derived from the project are sensitive to the diverse experiences of the veteran population.\n\nUnemployment Duration by Racial Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Unemployment duration by Racial Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line chart displays mean unemployment duration (in weeks) from 2020 to 2024 across several racial groups. Each line represents a racial category, showing how average unemployment spells have changed over time. A horizontal reference line at 15 weeks marks the threshold of long-term unemployment (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics), helping contextualize which groups and years exceed this benchmark.\nThis plot also highlights racial disparities in unemployment duration, particularly during the economic shocks of Covid Pandemic. While all groups experienced elevated unemployment durations during the early pandemic, the severity and pace of recovery differed across racial groups.\n\n\nProportion of Long-Term Unemployment by Racial Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportion of Long-term unemployment by Racial Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart visualizes the proportion of individuals experiencing long-term unemployment (defined as being unemployed for 15 weeks or more) across racial groups from 2020 to 2024. Even though the y-axis percentages are relatively small, they reflect meaningful differences in economic vulnerability.\nLong-term unemployment is a crucial measure in labor-market analysis because it reflects more than just temporary job loss, it signals deeper structural barriers that prevent individuals from successfully re-entering the workforce. When someone remains unemployed for an extended period, they are more likely to experience skill deterioration, weakened professional networks, and increasing challenges in securing future employment due to employer stigma associated with long job gaps. These barriers can create a cycle in which long-term unemployed individuals face progressively fewer opportunities, making it significantly harder to regain stable employment.\nIn addition, by using proportions rather than raw counts allows us to make meaningful comparisons across racial groups that differ in population size. Raw numbers can be misleading because a larger racial group will naturally have more individuals experiencing long-term unemployment simply due to its size, even if the risk of long-term unemployment is relatively low. Proportions standardize the measure, expressing long-term unemployment as a share of each group’s unemployed population, which enables us to evaluate disparities in likelihood rather than just absolute magnitude."
