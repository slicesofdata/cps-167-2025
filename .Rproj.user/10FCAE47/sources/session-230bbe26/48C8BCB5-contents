## Midterm Visualization Presentations

![Unemployment Duration by Veteran Status and Year](midterm_plot_1.png)

Some of my visualizations limitations include:

-   Over plotting

-   Cluttered

-   Could make the year label clearer

## Visualization Code

ggplot(mapping = aes(x= peafever, y= pelaydur, fill = peafever ))+ geom_boxplot()+

facet_wrap(\~year) +

theme_minimal()+

labs(title = "Unemployment Duration by Veteran Status and Year",

x = "Veteran status",

y = "Unemployment duration (weeks)") +

theme( #\| axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8) )+

scale_fill_discrete( name = "Veteran Status")

## Geom Reflections

I realized that a Box–Plot would be a good way of displaying the data, specifically the spread of the data. Despite this original assessment, I can see how other options may produce similar results.

1.  Violin Plot: I would have gotten many of the same benefits (displaying spread) as the box plot but could have included the shape of the data.
2.  Geom Col: I could have used the column plot to display the means by group, it would have been a more simple visualization.

Overall, I think my visualization was a good starting point for future work with the data. I know that the changes in unemployment from 2021 to 2022 are starkly different and that gives me more to explore.

## Additional Decorative Elements

1.  Color: I think I can chose colors outside of the default. However, I would like to discuss with my group which colors we would use for which variable.
2.  Legend: The legend takes up a good amount of space, however I think it is necessary to distinguish the groups from each other.
3.  Faceting: One of my main goals was to include time in my comparison. I would like to make each visualization larger in the future, perhaps needing to separate them by year.

## Final Thoughts

When constructing this visualization, I was mainly relating to principles of design, such as the ink to data ratio. I felt changing the theme was important since the visualization initially felt too cluttered. I also wondered if I was trying to have one visualization do too much work. [Shah & Carpenter (1995). Conceptual limitations in comprehending line graphs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slicesofdata/dataviz25/main/readings/Shah-Carpenter-(1995)-Conceptual-limitations-in-comprehending-line-graphs.pdf) addresses the limitations when line graphs have three data dimensions. Although I was not working with a line graph, I worried that similar effects would be amplified in a box plot.
