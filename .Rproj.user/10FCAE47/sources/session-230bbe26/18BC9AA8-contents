# Assembling your Elements 

You will ensure that your data and plotting scripts needed for creating your plot are used to build the up-to-date version of the plot.

## Code Block for Sourcing Your Scripts

```{r}
# source data-related scripts 

library(here)
source(here("cleaning_script_cps.R"))

# source plotting script(s)

source(here("dr_midterm_plots_script.R"))






```

## The Modified Plot

I want to change my plots to represent the shape of the data more based on what we have most recently learned. I decided to make a violin plot and implement the sina plot layered on top. I decided to focus the plot more and focus on the median weeks of unemployment, 9.




## Code Block for Embedding your PNG

```{r}
# plot with a caption

#| fig.cap: "Updated plot after midterm revisions and added knowledge"
#| fig.align: "center" # to center plot on page if desired
#| out.width: "100%"   # or some other % appropriate for you site

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "Unemployment_Duration_Distribution_by_Veteran_Status.png"))
```
